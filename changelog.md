# Changelog

## 3rd Party Scripts
- Installed **DOMPurify** to parse malicious script inputs for the various dialog prompts used in homework 4. I also used this for the title and summary of the CRUD Blog.
- Installed **ESLint** to help keep my javascript standardized and avoid syntax issues.

## Portfolio Site Changes
- I attempted to add a rainbow function to change the main background in main.js, but it didn't work for some reason.
