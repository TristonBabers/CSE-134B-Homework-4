## Notes:
- I added a background Color selector on the blog posts, as well as recording the date posted at the bottom.
- For the styled crud blog I could not figure out how to change the styling of the blog posts themselves without having to re-write everything, because I added blog posts using the shadow DOM which does not react to regular CSS files.
- I spent all of my time on the blog section of this assignment and did not make any changes to my portfolio site.
